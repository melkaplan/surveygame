      The following is a survey regarding self-construal and experience with blockchain technologies.
      <br><br>
      The survey is expected to take around <strong><span id="time">-</span> minutes</strong> to complete.

      <br><br>
      The survey consists of 4 steps. You will first be asked for
      some demographic information. In the second step you will be asked questions about how you define yourself in relation to others. 
      The third step is a quiz on your knowledge of blockchain technology. In this step please select "I don't know" if you do not know the answer.
      The accuracy of your answers will have no effect on your final payment. The final step consists of questions about your involvement with blockchain technology.

      After finishing the survey you will be directed to a waiting room in which you will wait for 3 other players to connect before starting the game.
