      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Using data beyond this study:</strong>
        <span id="exp-secondary-use">The researcher would like to make the information collected in this study
        available to other researchers after the study is completed. The researcher
        will remove any identifying information (such as your name,
        contact information, etc.) connected to the information you provide.
        Examples of other studies include meta-analyses of similar studies that
        aggregate information from multiple participants from a broad range of
        studies. Researchers of future studies will not ask your permission for
        each new study and will not have access to your name and other information
        that could potentially identify you, nor will they attempt to do so.
